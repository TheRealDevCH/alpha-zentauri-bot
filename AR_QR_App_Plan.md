# AR Scanner + QR Placement App Plan

This document outlines a high-level approach to build an app that allows a user to scan a real-world object with a mobile device, generate a QR code from the captured data, and then share this QR code. When another user scans the code, they can place the same object in augmented reality (AR) and view it from any angle.

## 1. Capture Object in AR
1. Use ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android) to access device cameras and depth sensors.
2. Guide the user to slowly move around the object to collect 3D data (point cloud or mesh).
3. Optionally compress or optimize the 3D model for storage and transmission.

## 2. Serialize & Store Data
1. Convert the captured 3D data into a common format (e.g., glTF or USDZ).
2. Store the file on a server or use a decentralized approach like IPFS.
3. Keep a reference URL or hash to this file.

## 3. Generate QR Code
1. Use the reference URL or hash as the content of a QR code.
2. Generate and display the QR code in the app for sharing.

## 4. Scanning & Placement
1. When a user scans the QR code, decode the reference URL/hash.
2. Download or load the 3D model using this reference.
3. Use ARKit/ARCore to place the model in the environment.
4. Allow the user to move, rotate, and scale the object, viewing it from all sides.

## 5. Security & Privacy
- Ensure proper permissions for camera and storage access.
- Provide clear instructions for data usage and sharing.

## 6. Tech Stack Suggestions
- **Frontend**: Swift/SwiftUI (iOS) or Kotlin/Java (Android).
- **AR Libraries**: ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android). Unity or Unreal for cross-platform.
- **Backend**: Node.js or Python for file storage and retrieval, or use a serverless approach.
- **QR Generation**: Use libraries like `qrcode` in Python or platform-specific equivalents.

This plan covers the basic workflow. Implementing a production-ready version requires careful attention to file sizes, network transfer, and user experience across different devices.
